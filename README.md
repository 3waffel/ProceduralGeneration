## CURRENT STATUS

WROTE SOME CODES ON TRIVIAL ROOM GENERATION

## TODO

IMPLEMENT CODES FROM ALGORITHM

## ALGORITHM

### ~~Random Numbers~~

### ~~Height Map~~

### Sequence Generation

-   [ ] Lindenmayer Systems
-   [ ] Markov Chains

### Fill Space

-   [ ] Random Walks
-   [ ] Cellular Automata
-   [ ] Settling
-   [ ] Wang Tiles
-   [x] Binary Space Partition
    - ![PCG](./images/monogame_demo_RJuErwfimF.png)
    - there's some wrong judgements when the player intersects with the rooms.
-   [ ] Voronoi Diagrams
-   [ ] Dijkstra Maps
-   [ ] Tree Mapping
